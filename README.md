### This is a repo made *specifically* for my *STATS220* course. 

This is also:
1. The **only stage 2** course I'm taking this semester.
2. My first time using Github!

I took this course because
* I need it for my stats major
* I thought the [course outline](https://courseoutline.auckland.ac.nz/dco/course/STATS/220/1243) sounded super interesting
